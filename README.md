## NumPy Overview

NumPy is a powerful Python library for numerical computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. Here are some key highlights:

- **Array Creation**: NumPy allows easy creation of arrays from lists, tuples, or using functions like `arange()`, `linspace()`, and `random()`.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Perform element-wise operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on arrays.
- **Broadcasting**: Enables operations on arrays of different shapes, streamlining complex calculations.
- **Linear Algebra**: NumPy includes functions for matrix operations, solving linear equations, eigenvalues, and more.
- **Statistical Functions**: Compute mean, median, standard deviation, variance, and other statistical metrics.
- **Array Manipulation**: Reshape, slice, index, and concatenate arrays effortlessly.
- **Integration with Pandas**: NumPy arrays form the foundation of Pandas, making it integral to data analysis and manipulation.

### Installation

To install NumPy using pip, run the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy
